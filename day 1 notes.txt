My assumptions:
1)i am assuming the client is from US/Europe therefore HIPPA and GDPR applies
2)google STT and TTS is the best but i have had troubles in past while working with it
3)i have added additional things like rate limiter and cache which are optional for mvp but necessary in a real application
 for efficiency and security
4)In my ERD i assumed that each session results in 0-1 prescription and transcript but this might be wrong as what if a session gets disturbed
 due to some issue so there can be fragments of transcripts (i.e multiple transcripts). I will need your suggestions for this
